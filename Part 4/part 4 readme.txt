A) I've included a screenshot of the results, in case that doesn't show up the 
results in order were "12 Years a Slave", "Hacksaw Ridge", "Queen of Katwe", 
"The Wind Rises", and "A Beautiful Mind". These results were based on the file 
movies_recommendation_data.csv and thus were unaffected by the previous data points 
that I added in part 2. 

B) I found the results to be accurate with given data, which can be proved (to a
certain point) by rerunning the program a few times. The execution speed was 
incredible, although this was a rather small dataset which was likely a factor.

C) If you want to find more movie reccomendation based datasets, Kaggle contains 
a plethora of available sets. I've included a link to show exactly where to go 
to find more useful datasets for this project.
